#### Linked List

* [X] is a linear collection of specially designed elements called nodes, linked to one another by means of pointers.

#### Stack

* [X] Last in First out
* [X] Insert operation to stack called push and removing exsiting elements from stack called pop which performed at one end calle top.
* [X] Implementation of stack using linked list is Insert at the end and delete from the end.

#### Queue

* [X] First in First out(FIFO)
* [X] Insert new elements into queue using front gate and delete the existing element from queue using rear gate.
* [X] While inserting new element the front incremented by one and deleting the existing element from queue the front also will incremented by one.

#### Binary Search Tree(BST)

* [ ] Every node has a key and no two elements have the same key.
* [ ] The keys in the right subtree are larger than the keys in the root.
* [ ] The keys in the left subtree are smaller than the keys in the root.
* [ ] The left and the right subtrees are also binary search trees.
